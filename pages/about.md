**Introduction: Walls as Media Objects and Mediators of Meaning**

In our contemporary world, the concept of a media object has transcended the digital realm to include physical structures that mediate and influence communication, access, and behavior. Walls—ubiquitous yet overlooked—function as powerful entities within our landscapes. As physical barriers, they divide space, regulate access, and communicate messages. As conceptual and symbolic structures, they shape thought, movement, and cultural understanding. They also can be embedded with more traditional technologies that are in fact digital, such as cameras, microphones, and other sensors in order to track and monitor behavior. 

In my own experiences I have felt how walls not only direct my movements through lived spaces, but also how they shape my thinking and my interactions. Much like anything in the environment they can impact my mood, prompt a thought, or inspire me to action.  

What can we learn from walls and other inanimate objects if we study and take seriously how they make us feel, think, and behave? This archive is an exploration of the possibilities and limitations of nontraditional media objects—how they shape communication, define boundaries, and mediate our relationships with each other and the world. By situating these overlooked objects within our broader media landscape, we can uncover their power to illuminate deeply rooted societal issues such as capitalism, colonialism, and racism. These objects, though static, embody systems of control, access, and exclusion, forcing us to confront how our environments influence not only our movements but also our thoughts, emotions, and sense of belonging.

In a world more interconnected than ever through technology and media-driven communication, these very systems have amplified global conversations about wealth inequality, environmental degradation, war, and systemic injustice. At the same time, they have deepened divisions—splitting communities along social, racial, ethnic, gendered, and religious lines. Walls, whether physical or digital, are both a symptom and a reflection of these contradictions: they connect and divide, protect and oppress, include and exclude.

By critically examining these boundaries and their impact, this archive challenges us to rethink how we communicate, inhabit space, and interact with one another. In doing so, it reveals an opportunity not only to critique but also to reimagine the ways we build connections and break barriers—offering a vision for a more equitable, reflective, and empathetic world. 


**Media Archaeology and Everyday Walls: Understanding Boundaries as Dynamic Media Objects**

This project examines walls through the lens of media archaeology, exploring how these seemingly static objects function as dynamic systems that both reflect and enforce societal structures. While walls are often overlooked as mundane architectural elements, this approach reveals their role as media objects—artifacts that regulate access, communicate meaning, and mediate power. Drawing on the work of Jussi Parikka, Lisa Gitelman, John Durham Peters, and others media archaeology provides a framework to investigate walls not as isolated artifacts but as interconnected phenomena embedded in historical, social, and material contexts.

In particular, this project was inspired by John Durham Peters work and his descriptions of media as “vessels and environments, containers of possibility that anchor our existence and make what we are doing possible (Peters). Walls, as both physical and digital boundaries, fit this expanded definition. They mediate communication, regulate behavior, and shape perceptions of space and place. It is both exciting and challenging to think of how walls have something to say about how we interact and understand our media environments. Furthermore, Parikka writes about "doing" and focuses on the question of what "practices and spaces function as infrastructure of the humanities, including of media archaeology (Parikka)." I see walls "doing" more than just creating boundaries and protecting property - they offer themselves as sites of action and reaction, of dialogue and communication.  

Within this perspective, walls emerge as integral media artifacts that convey messages, define boundaries, and produce systems of exclusion.

**Walls as Media Objects**

This archive attempts to address and think through how walls might be understood as media objects. In many ways some walls already actively do this, but I am much more curious about how fences, walls, and other infrastructures communicate and can be understood within the broader media landscape.
	
1.  **How do they communicate information?** Walls signal spatial boundaries, immediately conveying messages about access, ownership, and restriction. A gated neighborhood communicates exclusion, while a graffiti-covered wall speaks of resistance or cultural expression. These messages are encoded into the very presence and design of walls, making them communicative artifacts that define how we interact with space.

2.  **Structure Systems of Exclusion**  Walls enforce inclusion and exclusion, often functioning as mechanisms of power that determine who belongs and who does not. This structuring applies to both physical and digital barriers: a locked gate restricts movement in the same way a paywall or firewall limits access to digital information. In doing so, walls produce and reinforce systems of privilege, separation, and control.

3.	**Frame Cultural and Social Landscapes** Walls shape urban environments and social interactions, functioning as canvases for communication, resistance, and meaning-making. Murals, graffiti, posters, and informal messages transform walls into media surfaces that reflect communal stories, struggles, and identities. At the same time, institutional and corporate walls impose silence or control, reflecting the interplay between power and cultural expression.

**Everyday Walls: Reimagining the Mundane**

While monumental barriers like the Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall, or the US-Mexico Border Wall have been extensively studied, this project turns its attention to ordinary walls and fences that populate our day-to-day environments. Garden fences, gated streets, construction barriers, institutional enclosures, and even digital paywalls operate as mediators of everyday life, influencing our movements, perceptions, and access to resources. These everyday walls, though often overlooked, silently structure our lived realities in ways that are both subtle and profound.

For example, a chain-link fence around a vacant lot communicates neglect, separation, or control, while a mural-covered wall in a public square becomes a platform for cultural expression or protest. Walls such as these embed stories of power, resistance, and adaptation—whether they are built to divide, protect, or obscure. By examining these commonplace barriers, the project reveals how they mediate access, regulate movement, and shape cultural narratives about ownership, safety, and belonging.

The project also extends this exploration to digital walls, including paywalls, firewalls, and virtual surveillance systems, with particular attention to their impact on libraries and access to information. These digital structures serve as contemporary boundaries, regulating the flow of knowledge and creating systems of exclusion that often go unnoticed. Libraries, as institutions dedicated to the equitable dissemination of knowledge, face increasing challenges navigating these digital barriers. Paywalls and expensive database subscriptions limit access to scholarly materials, reinforcing hierarchies of privilege by determining who can engage with critical resources. Just as physical walls define who can enter or exit a space, digital walls dictate who has the right to access academic articles, research databases, and digital collections, thus restricting the pursuit of knowledge for individuals and communities without institutional or financial privilege. By drawing connections between physical barriers and the paywalls that libraries encounter and mediate daily, the archive highlights how boundaries—both seen and unseen—shape power, access, and identity in profound ways, particularly within the realms of scholarship, education, and public knowledge.

**Creating an Archive of Walls**

The creation of this archive draws on the methods and insights of media archaeology to explore walls as media objects that are embedded in the rhythms of daily life. By prioritizing personal experiences and focusing on ordinary, overlooked boundaries, this project uncovers the powerful and often hidden ways walls structure our environments and relationships. From chain-link fences to digital paywalls, these boundaries regulate access, define belonging, and communicate meaning in ways that are both tangible and symbolic.

Through this lens, walls emerge not as silent structures but as active participants in the media landscape, carrying messages of power, resistance, and adaptation. This project invites us to see the mundane and the overlooked as sites of critical reflection—reminding us that walls, like all media, shape not only our spaces but also our perceptions, behaviors, and collective stories.
