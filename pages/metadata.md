Choosing metadata fields for an archive about walls presents a unique challenge, particularly within the framework of media archaeology. Walls, both physical and conceptual, serve as mediums that shape communication, access, and power dynamics. Metadata fields for such an archive must navigate the interplay between materiality and meaning—capturing the wall as both an object and a social construct.

In media archaeology, the wall is not merely a static barrier but a participant in communication systems, mediating who can see, hear, or access information. For instance, a field like “Material Composition” might be necessary to contextualize a wall’s durability or transparency, while “Temporal Context” could situate it within specific technological or cultural developments. The challenge lies in creating fields that respect the wall’s multifaceted nature without oversimplifying its role in shaping human interaction.

Moreover, walls influence how and with whom we communicate. Fields such as “Function” (e.g., boundary, screen, memorial) and “Audience Impact” could capture the sociopolitical and emotional layers of walls. The difficulty arises in ensuring these fields reflect not just the wall’s historical role but also its speculative potential in shaping future media environments. Ultimately, this process demands a balance between precision and openness to interpretation, fostering rich, multidimensional engagement.

The metadata fields that I have chosen to capture include the following:

**Author**
The individual or group responsible for documenting and creating an entry for this archive.

Why?
Identifying the author helps to understand the context and relationship to the wall. Who is writing is almost as important as what is being documented.

**Label**
A short, descriptive title or name for the wall or entry.
	•	Importance: Clear labels provide an accessible point of entry for users to identify and understand the wall or artifact at a glance. Labels help organize diverse entries in the archive and make connections between walls of similar types or functions.

**Experience**
A description of the personal or collective experience associated with the wall, including encounters, memories, emotions, or perceptions.
	•	Importance: Capturing the subjective experience gives depth to the archive by focusing on human interactions with walls. It reveals how everyday barriers impact lives—whether through exclusion, protection, disruption, or inspiration—emphasizing their emotional and social significance.

**Date**
Description: The date when the wall was constructed, encountered, documented, or repurposed.
	•	Importance: Including dates provides temporal context, enabling users to trace the history, transformation, and relevance of walls over time. It also allows for an analysis of how societal attitudes toward walls evolve in relation to specific cultural, political, or economic events.

**Artifact Type**
A classification of the type of wall or object being documented (e.g., fences, murals, gates, sound barriers, digital paywalls, photos, articles, or other archival materials).
	•	Importance: Categorizing artifact types helps establish patterns and themes within the archive. It reveals the diversity of materials and walls in everyday life—both physical and digital—and their varying roles, from utilitarian structures to expressive canvases.

**Wall Characteristics**
Physical or material attributes of the wall, such as height, texture, material composition (e.g., wood, concrete, chain-link), color, or state (intact, weathered, broken).
	•	Importance: Documenting the tangible characteristics highlights how walls shape sensory experiences. Texture, form, and material can influence perception, access, and symbolism, enriching the analysis of walls as media objects with aesthetic and functional dimensions.

**Location**
The geographic or spatial context where the wall is located, including street address, neighborhood, or broader region.
	•	Importance: Location situates the wall in its social, cultural, and urban environment. It allows for spatial analysis, such as identifying patterns of exclusion, gentrification, or communal expression across different areas. Mapping walls can also highlight their role in shaping everyday mobility and behavior.

**Source**
	•	Description: The origin of the information, image, or narrative, such as personal documentation, oral histories, archival records, or media sources.
	•	Importance: Recording sources ensures the credibility and traceability of the archive. It allows users to verify data and understand the context of the information, encouraging transparency and scholarship.

**Purpose**
	•	Description: The original intent or function of the wall (e.g., boundary marking, privacy, safety, exclusion, aesthetics).
	•	Importance: Understanding purpose reveals how walls reflect societal needs, fears, and values. It distinguishes between walls built for protection versus those erected for exclusion, offering insight into the ideological and practical motivations behind barriers.

**Repurpose**
	•	Description: Any transformations, adaptations, or new uses of the wall over time (e.g., murals painted on barriers, fences turned into gardens, digital paywalls adapted for free access).
	•	Importance: Repurposing reflects the evolving relationship between people and walls. It demonstrates how individuals or communities reclaim and reimagine walls as spaces for resistance, creativity, or dialogue, emphasizing their dynamic nature in everyday life.
