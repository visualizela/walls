*Fickers, Andreas, and Annie van den Oever, eds. Doing Experimental Media Archaeology: Theory. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2022.*

Fickers and van den Oever provide a foundational exploration of experimental media archaeology. They integrate theory and hands-on practice in order to provide a model for how to engage with media objects. They bring into focus the materiality, performative qualities, and epistemic dimensions of artifacts which helps to provide a methodological framework that could be applied to creating an online archive of walls. Specifically, the volume’s focus on “thinkering”—a process of thinking through doing—supports an interactive, experiential approach to examining walls as media objects. For an archive centered on personal and everyday encounters with walls, this text underscores the importance of treating these structures as dynamic artifacts that mediate access, perception, and spatial relationships. It guides curators to uncover walls’ tactile, symbolic, and cultural dimensions, connecting their mundane physicality to larger technological and social narratives within a media archaeology framework. In my own case the text provided much needed inspiration for thinking through a metadata field could highlight what engagement might look and feel like with a wall.

Katie Day Good’s work explores how analog structures, such as walls, posts, and bulletin boards, have historically served as forms of social mediation—spaces where communication, information-sharing, and expression occur. This text is particularly useful for creating an online archive of walls within a media archaeology framework because it draws attention to the communicative and connective functions of physical walls, reframing them as media objects that facilitate both interaction and exclusion. Good’s analysis encourages an exploration of how everyday walls—whether as sites for posters, graffiti, murals, or informal notes—carry messages and meaning that shape public and private spaces. By focusing on the materiality and social uses of walls, this work supports the archive’s emphasis on personal experiences, revealing how mundane structures mediate relationships, narratives, and histories within everyday life.


*van der Heijden, Tim, and Aleksander Kolkowski, eds. Doing Experimental Media Archaeology: Practice. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2023.*

This companion volume to Doing Experimental Media Archaeology: Theory focuses on the practical applications of experimental media archaeology, offering guidance on recreating historical experiences through hands-on methods. The book outlines ways in which reconstruction, documentation, and interpretation might help to provide insights for developing an online archive of walls that prioritizes personal and everyday interactions with these structures. In particular, the book provides ways to explore how hands-on experimentation and collaborative practices could engage inquiry into how walls, understood as media artifacts, mediate space, perception, and access. The text provides ways to think through how an archive about walls can incorporate sensory and material dimensions, such as their textures, boundaries, and symbolic functions. More importantly it also provides ways to think through how personal narratives can highlight their impact on everyday life.


*Ytre-Arne, Brita. Media Use in Digital Everyday Life. Cham: Palgrave Macmillan, 2023.*

This book explores how digital technologies and media integrate into the rhythms of daily experience, shaping how people interact with their environments. The book provides a nuanced analysis of mediated spaces and interactions, making it particularly relevant for thinking about how walls help to structure and define our everyday experiences. 

By examining how media and digital infrastructures structure access, communication, and perception, Ytre-Arne’s work offers valuable frameworks for understanding walls as media artifacts—both physical and digital—that regulate movement and define boundaries in contemporary life. Chapters explore deeply ways to approach media use in the everyday and mundane which are incredibly helpful when thinking about how to engage and develop an archive about walls. The focus on how media objects create "connections" which is extremely helpful when considering how walls can act as media objects in their own right.

This text encourages curators to consider how everyday barriers function as mediated interfaces, connecting individual experiences to larger technological and social systems within a media archaeology context. The text helps to develop a methodological frame of reference for how to curate a collection of objects that are in some ways static yet are still loaded with meaning that can be revealed through everyday experiences.
