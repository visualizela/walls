The USC Security Fence: A Reflection on Media, Communication, and Power

The recent construction of a security fence and perimeter around the University of Southern California (USC) in response to student encampments offers a unique lens through which to understand media, communication, and systems of power. The fence and security apparatus was erected to provide security but is also acts as a symbolic and communicative structure that reveals broader societal trends. In its form and function, USC’s response mirrors strategies employed by the United States and Israeli (and many other) governments during moments of political unrest, where the erection of physical barriers becomes a default mechanism for maintaining control rather than addressing underlying problems.

At its core, the USC perimeter has turned the campus into a mediated space where access is regulated and controlled through security checkpoints. Students, faculty, staff, and community members must now pass through these checkpoints, presenting identification and undergoing surveillance before entering campus. The daily experience of passing through these barriers normalizes the presence of checkpoints and the logic of policing, exclusion, and surveillance. Much like the heavily monitored borders in Palestine and other occupied areas, USC’s fence does not merely create a physical boundary but also mediates how individuals move through, perceive, and engage with the university space.

From a media and communication perspective, this action by the university operates on multiple levels. First, it communicates power—the fence serves as a visible declaration of control, reinforcing authority while suppressing dissent. By enclosing the campus and requiring identification, the university signals that certain individuals belong, while others must be monitored, questioned, or excluded. This messaging reflects a broader political response seen in global contexts, where physical barriers are deployed as tools of power to silence opposition and fragment communities.

Second, the fence transforms the campus into a surveilled environment, where every movement is monitored, cataloged, and regulated. This mirrors digital forms of surveillance, such as firewalls or virtual checkpoints, that similarly control access to information and space. The normalization of these checkpoints at USC reinforces a cultural shift toward accepting policing and surveillance as routine aspects of life, while diminishing the possibilities for open dialogue and trust-building. Just as physical and digital barriers shape who can access resources or participate in political action, USC’s perimeter structures how students engage with campus space, effectively framing dissent as something to be contained and controlled rather than understood or addressed. I have overheard students repeatedly blaming the encampment and Palesinian activism on campus for the security, sowing distrust and even hate between students rather than thinking about the larger (and much more important) issues at stake.

The parallels with the US and Israeli government responses to uprisings and protests are clear. In Palestine, walls, checkpoints, and surveillance systems fragment communities, restrict movement, and create zones of heightened policing. Instead of addressing the root causes of unrest—whether that be political oppression, apartheid, displacement and disposssion, economic inequality, or territorial disputes—these barriers suppress dissent by making life more restricted and controlled. Similarly, USC’s fence prioritizes the appearance of security over meaningful engagement with the grievances that prompted the student encampments.

By framing students’ actions as threats that necessitate a physical and monitored perimeter, the university avoids grappling with the complex social, political, and ethical issues raised by the protests. The fence becomes a mediated response - a message that asserts power while silencing dissent, shifting focus from dialogue to discipline. Remarkably, the University recently cut funding to the Daily Trojan, a student run and operated newspaper, that documented much of the University's response to the student protests. The funding cuts were prompted by the University's financial situation, which in part has been excaberated by the heightened security measures. 

This transformation of USC’s campus is troubling not only because it suppresses protest but also because it normalizes a logic of walls, checkpoints, and policing within an educational space that should foster critical thinking, openness, and discussion. For students, the experience of passing through checkpoints to access their campus mirrors the lived realities of individuals in politically contentious spaces across the world, where walls are used to divide, surveil, and control. This normalization risks desensitizing students to the broader implications of physical and digital barriers in society, making them more accepting of systemic policing and surveillance elsewhere. It is form of traumatic oppression that especially impacts those who are already marginalized, minoritized, and advocating for social justice issues. Many USC and University students more broadly across the United States have made clear that activism and social justice causes are part of the reason why the choose to go to University and Universities accepted them for these reasons. They are now saying their thinking and activism is no longer welcome within the academic community.

In conclusion, USC’s security fence serves as more than a response to student protests; it is a powerful media object that communicates authority, reinforces systems of exclusion, and mirrors global strategies of suppression. By transforming the campus into a gated, monitored space, the university creates a physical manifestation of the societal trend toward policing over problem-solving. This response, rather than engaging with students’ demands or fostering dialogue, imposes a structure that reflects a troubling normalization of control. In doing so, USC’s fence forces us to confront the ways in which walls—whether in Los Angeles or Palestine—mediate access, communication, and power, shaping not only the spaces we inhabit but also the ways we think, move, and resist.

USC was officially founded in 1880 and at that time, according to the USC website, the city still "lacked paved streets" among other amenities and there were few defining boundaries and features. Since then the campus has grown exponentially and become a defining feature of the Los Angeles landscape. Over time and through several iterations of planning documents it has has created a defined campus that is at once a part of but very distinct from the city of Los Angeles. Even a few decades ago streets cut right through the heart of campus. Once aspect of campus design and development though, especially recently, has consistently been fortifying the campus perimeter anytime any threats have occured. Whether it was the Watts rebellion which occured at around the same time as the 1960s Master Plan was being implemented or more recently during isolated cases of violence on or nearby campus. The University has shown a willingness to create barriers and try close off threats rather than address them.

Within this context I can't help but think and ask:

1. How does exclusion shape thinking on campus? What does that mean for the future of higher education?
2. How does an us vs. them mentality on a campus shape discourse around national and international issues? What does it mean for the city of Los Angeles as it addresses housing shortages and unhoused individuals. 
3. How does this have an impact on student and community identity and does the University really care about supporting marginalized and minoritized groups and individuals both on campus and off campus?
