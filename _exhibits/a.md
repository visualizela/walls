USC was officially founded in 1880 and according to the USC website the "city still lacked paved streets" among other amenities. Since then the campus has grown exponentially and become a defining feature of the Los Angeles landscape. I want to focus on one element of the campus in particular that has helped to define, for better and worse, USC. The walls, fences, and barriers that restrict and provide access to USC have changed drastically over time. 


1. Founding of the University and especially emphasize how it was at the cusp of LA developing as a city. Few boundaries, roads, and other features. 

2. Show a series of maps and aerial images that highlight how integrated the campus was into the city and how it slowly emerged and defined its "space" and "boundaries"

3. Focus on the 1960s and the master plan and the vision for what an urban university should be. Couple this with the Watts Rebellion in 1965.

4. Show the continued expansion and construction of the USC walls through the 80s and the 1992 Los Angeles uprising. Consider how important the uprising was to USC and its relationship to the community.

5. Discuss more contemporary events that have pushed division at USC between community and the admin and students. Especially in 2013 when two students were murdered near campus and the most recent student encampments. Focus on how USC uses "safety" as a way to keep out and create a more robust infrastructure of access and inclusion.

Questions:
1. How does exclusion shape thinking on campus?
2. How does an us vs. them mentality on a campus shape discourse around national and international issues?
3. How does this have an impact on identity and supporting marginalized and minoritized groups and individuals both on campus and off campus?
