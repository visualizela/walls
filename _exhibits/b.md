Many questions emerge from studying closely our day-to-day relationship with walls, fences, and other structures that mediate and structure our access to spaces in our physical and digital lives.

1. One recent phenomena that might be better understood within this context is the recent focus on the term safety in order to justify repressive actions such as policies that limit free speech and political activity. 

2. In what ways can a dialouge around our lived experiences with walls help to develop real world policies that might improve 

3. What communities might help show how to develop and create "defined" spaces that put into question structures that create exclusivity etc. For example the gatherings of the Radical Faeries, Critical Mass bike rides, Slab City, or other failed communities like Llano Del Rio.
