label: Angelus Rosedale Cemetery wall
experience: This cemetry I first encountered when running in Los Angeles. More recenlty
  I have driven by it on a weekly basis and have noticed the tents and how they have
  become part of the infrastructure. As homelessness becomes more and more criminalized
  it is remarkable to see these "safe" spaces crop up. What is it about this particular
  strip by the cemetry that draws people to create more permanent looking housing?
