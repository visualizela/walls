pid: obj0004
author: Andy Rutkowski
label: Clark Memorial Library wall
experience: This is another wall that encountered running when I first moved to Los
  Angeles. I had no idea about the Clark Library but I knew something substantial
  was housed behind the beautiful ivy and brick wall. Though only a few minutes from
  the Angelus Rosedale Cemetry no unhoused individuals have tried to setup tents here.
