obj0001,Andy Rutkowski,A fence around an empty lot.,"This is a fence which surrounds a vacant lot that I have walked around for years. I first encountered it back in 2013 when I moved to Los Angeles. It is a beautiful field with full grown trees. In the morning if you walk by it you can hear birds singing, almost inviting you in. I have never seen anyone inside the fence although every once in a while someone must go in to clean up and maintain the grass. The longer I have lived in LA and learned more about this site the more it saddens me that it has remained empty for nearly 10 years. A public library was once on this site and it moved ",2024,wall,chainlink fence,private,Andrzej Rutkowski,"3663 S.
